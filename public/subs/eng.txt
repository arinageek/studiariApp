(MAN) Still or shot!
(Shooting)
(WOMAN) No!
"My name is Tokyo.
But when this story began, he didn't call me that.
This was me
And this, the love of my life.
The last time I saw him I left him in a pool of blood
with the eyes open.
We made 15 clean robberies,
But mixing love and work never works.
So, when the security officer fired, I had to change my profession.
From thief to murderer.
And that's how I started to run away.
Somehow, I was also dead.
Or almost dead.
I had been hiding for 11 days
and my photo was wallpapering the police stations throughout Spain.
I would fall 30 years.
And, really, I'm not even getting old
in a prison cell.
I am rather fleeing.
In body and soul.
And if I can't carry my body,
unless my soul escapes. "
(Ringtone)
"I had no time left and there were important things to do.
Actually, just one. "
(Phone)
Yes.
"Mom?".
Oh my girl
"How are you darling?".
What's going on?
"Didn't you watch the news?"
All those things they say about me.
Yes, of course I have seen them.
You know what?
I'm thinking of going on a trip.
"Maybe I got on a Chinese ship.
Cook's
Didn't you say I didn't know how to make an omelet?
I learn that way. How about?".
I do not know, darling.
And if they eat all Chinese, what?
What does that trip mean,
"I'm not going to see you again?"
What nonsense you say.
Of course you will see me.
"I will buy you a ticket to come and visit me."
Visit you where?
To the cemetery?
Are you alone?
Mom, are you alone?
Yes.
"Then go down to the street, as if you were going to the market.
I will find you. "
"And that day, the day I went to the slaughterhouse,
My guardian angel appeared.
But one never knows for sure what a guardian angel is like
and the least you can imagine is that it appears in a Seat Ibiza
of 92 ".
Sorry, do you have a minute?
Do not.
Cooking on a Chinese ship has only one advantage,
You don't have to scrub the dishes.
"For a moment I thought of the Chinese
and in that I hate people who spit. "
Who are you, cop? Wait wait.
You are on your way to the slaughterhouse, you have a team waiting for you
and they have had a car for six days ...
Why am I going to believe you?
"And so I met the Professor,
pointing a gun at his balls. "
May l?
"The good thing about relationships
is that one ends up forgetting how they started. "
May l?
They are already at your mother's house.
That's why I came to help you.
I want to propose a business,
a robbery, a robbery ...
singular.
I'm looking for people who ...
Well, don't have much to lose.
How do they sound to you ...
"No one had given such a stick,
neither in New York, nor in London, nor in Monte Carlo;
so if my photo went back to the newspapers,
unless it was for the biggest robbery in history. "
I welcome you ...
and ... thanks for accepting this ...
This job offer.
(Laughs)
We will live here, away from the worldly noise.
Five months, the five months we will spend studying
How to hit How five months?
Are we crazy or what?
Look, people spend years studying
to have a salary, a salary that, at best,
It is still a salary, a shit salary.
What is five months?
I've been thinking about this ... much longer.
Not to return to work in my life.
Not you ...
Or your children.
All right.
At the moment you don't know each other and I want to keep it that way.
I don't want any names or personal questions,
Nor, of course, personal relationships.
I want everyone to choose a name, something simple.
It can be numbers, planets, cities ...
-Roll "Lord 17, Miss 23". -We started badly. I do not know
Remember my phone number. -That's why I tell you that.
-And planets? I can be Mars, this Uranus.
-I will not be Uranus, so you forget.
-What happens to Uranus? -He has a bad rhyme.
They are going to be cities, cities. We meet cities.
All right.
"And so I ended up calling myself Tokyo.
The one who looks at my ass is Mr. Berlin.
In search and capture.
Auction houses and vans.
His biggest blow, the Champs Elysees, in Paris.
It's like a shark in a pool.
You can bathe with him, but you are never calm.
And he was the commander in charge of the assault. "
(Coughs)
"The one who coughs is Mr. Moscow.
The first thing he dug was a mine in Asturias.
Then he realized that digging up would go further.
Six furs, three watch shops and the Caja Rural de Avilés.
Handles thermal lance and any industrial tool.
The one sitting behind Moscow is Denver, his son.
Drugs, teeth, broken ribs.
He is the king of disco fights.
Pure hot blood.
In a perfect plan, a time bomb.
River. It's my weakness.
It's like a Mozart, but with computers.
Program since 6 years and knows everything about alarms and electronics.
For the rest of life's things, it's as if I was born yesterday.
And there are the Siamese, Helsinki and Oslo.
Even in the most sophisticated plan, soldiers are needed
And what better than two Serbs.
They may think, but frankly, we will never know.
Nairobi,
hopeless optimist.
He has falsified tickets since he was 13 years old.
And now she is our quality manager.
She may be crazy, but the "fucking" is so funny. "
Think that every day the news will be talking about us,
that every family in this country will be wondering
what are we doing.
And you know what they are going to think?
They will think: "What bastards, I wish it had occurred to me."
"The Professor, without background, without registration.
The last time he renewed his ID was with 19 years.
For all intents and purposes, a ghost, but a very intelligent ghost. "
We're not going to steal ... anyone's money,
because we are going to like them.
And that is fundamental, it is essential that we have public opinion
from U.S.
We are going to be the freaking heroes of all these people.
But very careful, because at the moment there
a single drop of blood, this is very important,
as there is only one victim,
we will stop being Robin Hood
to simply become motherfuckers.
Teacher.
Miss Tokyo.
What are we going to steal?
The National Coin and Doorbell Factory.
Who chose the mask?
(BERLIN) What's wrong with the mask? - That is not scary.
You watch the robber movies and the masks are scary.
They are zombies, skeletons, death, I know, you feel ...
(BERLIN) With a gun in his hand
I assure you that a madman is more scary than a skeleton.
-Come now. -Who was the east mustache?
-Dalí, son, a Spanish painter. It was very good.
-A painter. -Yes.
-A painter to paint. -Yes.
- (RESOLVES)
Do you know what scares the hell? The puppets of the kids.
That is scary.
-What dolls?
-The Goofy, the Pluto, the Mickey Mouse, all these.
-A mouse with ears is more scary, you tell me?
-Well yes, asshole. Do you want me to hit you?
-Hey! -That I'm right. We'll see.
If a gun at gunpoint enters with a Mickey Mouse mask
On any side, Peña will think it's hung,
That will make a butcher shop. You know why?
Because weapons and children
It's a thing that never comes together, dad.
Yes or no? -See that way, it would be more dangerous,
more twisted
-Then a mask of Jesus Christ would cushion more, it is more innocent.
-That's why he says he hits two guns less than a Christ.
-Like a saint two guns. (MOSCOW) What else does it matter?
"It was evident that women were missing in the band."
(Brake)
"A woman can spend two days choosing shoes for a wedding,
but I would never spend a minute choosing masks for a robbery.
Everything we had planned started now
and in those tenths of a second I thought of all the innocent people
to which we would stop his life dry.
The Professor knew there was only one way to enter
at the Coin and Doorbell Factory with three tons
of arsenal artifacts. I was going to do it inside the truck
that entered the building every week
with the new reels of paper money ready to print.
And that was what we were going to do,
Enter the kitchen and escorted by the National Police.
In Spain, anything guarded by two zetas
it's something strongly protected. "
(Sirens)
"But if you inhibit any possibility
that they communicate by radio or telephone
and if you point to some 26-year-old kids
with five assault rifles to the head,
however armed they go,
the same thing happens to any of us. "
I said get off, pussy, from the fucking car!
"Let them scare off." You will do what I tell you!
"Courage and heroism have a price
and is greater than 1,600 euros per month
a guy with a uniform charges ... "Open the door of the truck, can you hear me?
"... or a truck driver."
Come on, pussy, open up!
"If those men had had their daughter
at the back of the truck, they would never have opened,
but who cares
a reels of paper money with a watermark? "
Hurry quickly!
Fuck, male! Come on!
(NAIROBI) Pull, pull, pull!
Sitting there. And now the three of you calm down;
if not, head butt.
(BERLIN) You will drive with a gun in the kidneys.
When they call on the radio to find out how everything is going,
you will answer calmly, as if everything were on wheels.
Is it clear?
"And in the middle of that chaos with guns
I remembered that last night they had asked me to marry
and that I would have preferred other plans.
But if you think about it,
you never find a good day for a robbery. "
Now you know what you have to do.
Don't take your eyes off the girl.
There can be no mistakes, are we?
He is 17 years old.
I think I can with her.
(Voices in the distance)
(Laughs)
(Mobile message)
Hi.
-Hello.
-Do you want to go out with me?
Okay. I leave you.
-No no no.
I don't have to think about it. So that means yes.
(WOMAN) Well, guys, we've arrived.
We will go directly to the museum lobby, where ...
Pedro, do the favor, don't do like in class.
We're going out neatly through both doors ...
And this is the facade of the Coin and Doorbell Factory.
The little lamb is entering.
Perfect.
Berlin, your turn.
(Siren)
(BERLIN) And now, be very careful with what you do.
-How are you, Javi? Where is Rafita?
-Shift change. (TOSE)
(STORNUDA)
-That's very good. Quiet.
(TEACHER) Okay, guys, let's get in.
Slowly
(TALK WITHOUT JUST BEING HEARED)
This is important. As soon as they give us the accreditations ...
Accreditations hanging from the neck.
They have to be visible throughout the visit, okay?
Do not come back.
When you're close, it's hard for me to breathe.
Then breathe,
because in nine months you are going to cut your breath.
Ahead.
(TEACHER) Well visible throughout the visit, guys.
Accreditation hanging around the neck. Lower your voice.
Berlin, the first camera, on your left.
Won't you tell me anything? I say to you
I'm pregnant and you stay so calm?
What do I do, I call my wife, I tell her to pick up the children
and we are all going to celebrate it? Oh my god.
(POLICE) Strip, strip. Go Go.
(RIVER) Entering.
Attentive, Tokyo.
Good!
"Alarms disconnected". Now.
Go on, give it, give it.
It was you yesterday who said you were wrong,
that you can't stand it, that you have problems.
Problems like any couple, Monica,
like any marriage that has three children,
Not that I was going to separate.
Monica, I've had three children, all three for in vitro fertilization,
I have been maintaining sterile relationships with my wife for more than 20 years
And now you come to tell me this.
You must be Shiva, the goddess of fertility.
"What are you insinuating?".
I have not come here for a pension, you know?
Not even for a divorce,
let alone for a paternity test.
I thought you loved me.
Y...
And it seems like a pretty idea.
Hard to fit into our lives, but ...
But a wonderful idea.
Listens!
What, you want to know what I'm going to do with your child?
That's what you want, right? Listen to me, don't rush.
(SHOUTS)
Still!
(BERLIN) Still.
Still! Don't move or bust you!
What happens? Do something! -Up up!
-Get out!
(SCREAM)
(Screams)
"Go Go!".
Quick! Still!
Go Go!
Come on!
Yes Yes!
Shit.
Go Go.
Here. Come on.
And this wonderful staircase, made of marble and granite ...
-Quietos!
(SCREAM)
Still!
(SCREAM)
Still, still! Come on!
Behind!
-Please no! Professor, we have a problem.
Ah! I don't see the little lamb.
I don't see it, pussy!
Miss Parker, where have you been?
(Screams)
Wait.
Please! -Let's go! There!
For for. For.
-Okay.
OK OK.
I am going very fast. I know.
(Voices and sobs)
We're going to immortalize this, right?
We will take a picture with your mobile.
Fuck...
Here? It's a bit shabby, isn't it?
-It's our first day.
You are very pretty.
I do not see the girl. I don't see her, fuck.
Open up Open up and get a little sexy.
What is your mobile? If you want, you delete it.
That this is for us, for you and for me.
Go, go, go.
With this photo you are going to paste it on the Internet.
-Give me the phone! Give me the phone!
Give me the mobile!
Give it to me!
Give me the phone, fuck! Give me the phone!
Give me the mobile!
Give me the phone!
Ah!
(Cries)
The first...
Good Morning.
I am the person in charge.
And, first of all, I want ...
Present my apologies.
Really, they are not ways to end the week.
(DENVER) Mobile.
-But you are here as hostages.
(DENVER) Mobile.
-If you obey, I guarantee you will come alive.
(DENVER) Name. -Alison Parker.
(DENVER) PIN. (ALISON) 2078.
-Mobile.
-Calm calm.
Quiet.
-PIN.
What do you need the PIN for?
Either you give me the damn PIN or I take it out with you. You will see.
-How much are you?
- (GROUNDED) Eight months.
-Of eight months.
-PIN.
With all the ready face you have
and you put that PIN shit. What an asshole. Your name.
Arthur. -Arturo what?
Arturo Román. -Arturo Román, very good. Arturito
(BERLIN) You are our safe-conduct here,
so I'm going to protect them.
-Hey...
Give me your hands Loose.
Loose. Loose.
What is your name?
-Ariadna.
-Ariadna.
Come with me. Come.
Quiet.
Feel my hands
Are they the hands of a monster? -Nerd.
-Because I'm not a monster.
I know perfectly how you feel.
Dry mouth, choking sensation ...
You have to try to calm down. Inspire.
Inspire.
Inspire.
That's. Please breathe all with me.
Inspire.
Soft, soft.
Take responsibility for your breathing. Turn.
That's. That's.
(Phone)
Miss Monica Gaztambide, please?
(Whispers) Don't move. Please do not move.
Shut up. Do not move.
Shut up.
Miss Monica Gaztambide,
Would you be so kind as to step forward?
It's me.
(Piece of metal falling)
(DENVER) You're a crack, dad.
You are "mu" big.
(CRAZY FUCKED)
Here you have to sleep very well, dad.
Here you have to sleep in luxury.
Oh! Papa, papa, papa, papa!
Fuck. Here, pum.
Pum, pum ...
-Come on, stop fooling around and work. Come on, pussy.
-This smells like a fucking mother.
It smells better than roast lamb, potato, than roast lamb.
Lie here, hell. -Come on, pussy.
-When did you have a bed like this?
You didn't have it in the bag.
Have you seen where we are, dad? That we are very big.
That we are very big.
-Chaval, make no mistake.
We are small.
Do you know how to do something?
Have you ever worked?
Have you submitted the curriculum somewhere?
Ah. Come on, pussy.
-The curriculum.
The curriculum for what?
To get you out of Alcala Meco?
- Do you think I'm proud of that?
entering and leaving the jail.
And do you know why?
-Why?
-Because I'm not very smart, son.
And you neither.
But in this blow the brain puts another.
And if we are lucky and you don’t do much the asshole,
You'll get out of here with your life resolved.
-I'm not going to do the asshole. -Come on, pussy.
Fill this out.
(Phone)
I want you to answer the phone
and convince whoever we are closed
For a technical problem. It is understood?
Yes.
I will have no choice but to aim with a gun.
Do you feel it? Yes.
All right.
(Phone)
Now.
National Coin and Doorbell Factory, tell me.
No, I'm sorry, I can't happen to Don Arturo right now.
The system has been dropped.
No, I can't make him come up.
No, you can't go up to pick up the phone, no.
No, it won't be.
No, for ...
Well, why not, because I don't know where he is right now,
because I don't know if it's in the factory, in the museum, in the cafeteria
or where it is! And besides, it's not my job, miss!
That has been an interpretation of Oscar,
Miss Gaztambide.
(BREATHE BREATHINGLY)
"After 20 minutes of entering, we began to wire the system
of analog communication to speak with the Professor ".
(SING IN YOUR LANGUAGE)
"Without mobiles, without radio frequency, without anyone being able to hear us.
We had sealed the doors and the alarms had not gone off.
We were like in a limbo of time, without anyone knowing
that we had taken the Coin and Doorbell Factory.
And in that sweet peace, before the storm,
it seemed, simply, an ordinary day. "
You are handsome, huh?
(Door)
Who?
(LAUGHTER) It's me, let me through.
Rio, uncle, the Professor catches us and kills us, you know?
I know, I know, I know. I have to talk to you. Sit down.
What happens? Sit down, pussy.
(RESOLVES)
What happens?
Tomorrow is the robbery.
And we have no fucking idea what's going to happen.
That's why I want you to know that I'm serious with you
and I fully understand that, well,
that you already have an age and ...
and that you might look for a ... a more serious commitment.
That's why I want to give you something.
I have not bought you a ring because we are locked up,
but, as soon as I leave, I will give you a pedruscazo
You'll have to carry your hand in a fucking wheelbarrow.
What is this?
A request plate?
Now at least you'll know my real name.
Already, but it is forbidden to know our names.
Well, don't look at him.
But it is yours.
Let's see how I tell you this.
Ours has been very good, okay? Great.
We have rolled up some nights ...
How some? Fuck, all, all. Minus four or five ...
Honestly, I don't think we are the ideal couple.
Don't we fuck well? Yes, we do fuck well, fantastic.
For something you start, right?
But it takes more than just fucking well
to be a couple, right?
Do you say it because I am
I'll have
I am no kid, I have a determined life.
Really, Rio, I wish we had ... Eh, how would we have?
There was love. There was love, I was there.
There is another, right?
No longer.
Look, Rio,
when all this is over, just like you and I go to Tahiti
and see if it works, but tomorrow I just want to think about one thing:
Don't kill me
River.
Rio, no.
Nerd.
You have left a mobile on.
Well, turn it off.
- Open armored chamber.
- Put on your vests and get ready to go out.
As soon as you are there, we will activate the alarm.
Berlin, ready to open the doors.
Hostage, for your safety, all three steps back!
A little more here. That's.
There we are. Everything will be fine.
A little more together.
Chist. Quiet.
Quiet. I am looking at the bags.
They have them full of money.
Now they will leave and nothing has happened here.

Two minutes.

Why did the alarm go off? I do not know.
They stand without doing anything, I don't understand.
Why do they take my money and leave?
I do not know!
One minute, 40 seconds.
-One minute...
What is your name?
Arthur.
Arturo, right?
Yes. No, I have not seen anything!
I have not seen anything, I swear, I have not seen anything, I have not seen anything!
Look at me. I have not seen anything.
Come, Arturo, look at me.
Look at me, look at me.
Hey, come on, go.

Hey.
Do you like movies
You like?
(Sobbing) I am ... I am very fond of.
And you have noticed that in scary movies
one always comes out at the beginning, well, majete like you,
that you say: "This one smells like dead",
and then it doesn't fail? Do not...
Always falls.
Arturo, believe me, you smell like dead.
(CRY)
(ISSUER) "Z24 to central, we are in 30 seconds."
"It is essential that the police"
Do not have the slightest idea of ​​what we are doing.
We will make them believe that we are going to steal,
that caught us running away with the money and that everything got screwed up,
that we take out our weapons, we shoot at point blank
and we had no choice ... but to recular.
"And then, without hurting"
to nobody,
we get inside.

A judge has taken custody of him and now I'm going to be me
The one that will take care of you. -He hasn't been a judge.
-Oh no? -Do not.
- And who has it been?

So yes, grandma?

Commissar.

The robbers have tried to go out with the money and have failed.
They have injured two policemen.
It is in the National Factory of Currency and Bell.
I want you to take the negotiation. "
-Send me a car. - "You have it at the door."
(DENVER) Explain to me what the fucking shit that has been!
Explain to me what the hell that was! Your head is going out!
You have riddled two policemen! -Calm down.
A fucking policeman was shooting at me.
What would you have done, spit on him?
Look, I screw up in my life! -What are you going to do, aunt,
what are you going to do, follow the fucking plan, fuck,
that we have reviewed
We weren't going to shoot anyone.
- I fell blocked with the impacts ... - Shut up!
That we also cover you, but shooting at the ground,
not to the bodies at close range.
(Door)
(BERLIN) They are already taking the injured policemen.
Are the phones connected?
Out any wireless or radio signal.
We turn to analog.
Call the teacher.
What is he wearing?
What is he wearing?
What is he wearing?
(Phone)
What happened? (BERLIN) "Two injured policemen."
Who has shot?
"Tokyo."
Connect the cameras to the Professor.
"They touched Rio and Tokyo shot."
Apparently they have a relationship.
Pass it to me.
"That?". That is true,
that you have a relationship with Rio? What the fuck are you saying?
Do not.
The love of my life died because of me,
The last thing I think about is having a relationship with a child.
"I shot to protect myself; me and my partner."
And, Mr. Professor, as much as you have thought about it, things
They don't always go as planned.
What happened? -They have burst a camera
from the Coin Factory to take the last plates.
-Why didn't the alarms go off? -You have jumped a manual alarm,
We assume it was a worker. -How many hostages?
- Impossible to know, the museum was open.
-Give me a number.
-Confirmed: 35 workers,
and 17 kids from the British College.
-What the hell were they doing there? -They were hiking.
- Have you transcended the press? -No, no, not yet.
-Attractors? -We don't know yet,
We are collecting images of nearby businesses.
(DOCTOR) He has lost a lot of blood. -How many can there be?
- Four have left, we believe that no less than six.
-Weapons?
-We know they have at least three M16.
And they are extremely aggressive. -The GEOs are here.
-Yes, they were the first to arrive.
-Please give me some good news.
-The police who have been shot are alive.
-Goodness.
Come on.
What about the cameras inside the building?
Where is the signal? -No signal.
- How not? -No sign, I don't know.
They must have broken or diverted it. We are working on it.
-What about the network?
-The fiber optic have been knocked down, we can't hack them.
-Listen to me all, Police, Civil Protection,
I want all phones disconnected.
We will release the repeater located on the roof of the building
In case they make any calls.
Any mobile signal from around the perimeter
I want you to enter directly here.
-Okay, I want to listen to the analysts here,
in two seconds Agree?
-Do we have the plans inside the building?
-I study a possible intervention.
"Volluto" intense.
Then they say that the civil servant is not taken care of.
-What the hell are you doing?
(BERLIN) It's our free time.
They have to set up camp, send us a drone,
look for building plans;
you have to give them a little time to get organized.
Hey, why would Tokyo have said you're not together?
-Because we are not.
- And why will I have heard every night the headboard of his bed
like a hammer hammer? Will you be learning to dance samba
at five in the morning? -Well I do not know,
I have no fucking idea. I don't know if samba dances or sleeps nervously.
-Tell me, do I look like a mamon to whom you can lie
as if they were spitting in his face?
I’m fucking.
If I had buzzed her too.
In fact, I may try.
-I think you're wrong, huh?
I am very serious with her.
-Seriously?
But really about having a garden and dedicating yourself to DIY
Sundays? -That's.
And fill it with children.
-Sit down.
Look, boy, women will give you sex and fun
because ... they are scheduled to bend you and let them fecund you.
Then you will cease to exist.
In childbirth you will realize that.
-Birth has to be the most exciting thing in a father's life.
-In delivery what will come out between your legs
It is a nuclear warhead that will destroy everything.
First, the wonderful cave where you put your picha
He will never return to his being.
And while he curses your name and asks for the epidural,
It will be done belly up.
Do you know what he is telling you with that?
That she will never be a sexy woman again.
And that from now on that coal is going to become
In the center of the universe.
They are all like that.
I tell you, I have had five divorces.
Do you know what five divorces are?
Five times I believed in love.
-What fucking shit do you have in your head?
Hey?
How the hell did the Professor put you in charge of this?
-For my sensitivity to treat people.
Now take the little lamb out of the group and take it to an office.
And don't separate from her.
If the compress is going to change, you by his side.
-Okay.
Come on.
Quiet, I'm going to take you to another place to rest, nothing more.
Okay?
-Raquel, all the communications we make from within
They should be done from this phone or radio, nothing mobile, okay?
-Put me inside, I want to talk to the robbers.
Angel, what the hell is Colonel Prieto doing here?
-I do not know. I do not know.
-There are individuals hitting shots on the site
where the money is made,
Don't you think that intelligence should be aware?
-Calling the Coin and Doorbell Factory, Raquel.
-Boss, call inside in progress.
(Ringtone)
(Doorbell)
(Ringtone)
(Doorbell)
(Phone)
(RACHEL) "Hello."
Good afternoon. - "I'm Raquel Murillo,"
Inspector in charge of the robbery management. With whom I speak?
(DISTORTIONED) "With the robber in command of the assault."
-Has voice modifier. -Cleaning the signal.
How are your classmates?
(RACHEL) At the moment we don't have to regret any casualties.
"I'm glad".
Really, honestly.
Excuse me, I hear you a little weird.
Yes, I apologize for this hateful metallic voice,
"But you will understand that I must safeguard my identity,"
in case one day they put us a helicopter and we go to Brazil.
Is that what you want, a helicopter?
"For now, what I want is to negotiate with someone"
That is not giving me long, that I do not have to ask
to a superior, to Intelligence or his mother to say yes or no.
Then I should talk to the president,
but since he’s busy running the country,
I will try to replace him,
"If it doesn't seem bad."
Any other question? "Yes".
What is he wearing?
How? "How is she dressed?
Don't you think our clothes "
Do you talk a lot about our personality?
Look, I don't mind answering your question,
but I think I should inform you
"that this conversation is being heard by several members
of the UDEF, of the ITU, the CNI "
and his liaison cabinet, the GEO chief and several other officers.
In that case, I think the polite thing is to greet and introduce ourselves.
Gentlemen, a pleasure.
"Sorry I don't give you my name, but you can call me"
Professor, it's what everyone calls me.
Hi. I’m Angel, Police Assistant Inspector.
Delighted, Angel. How are you, how are you?
-"Hello good day". Good Morning.
-Hello how are you?
Very good. I very well, thank you very much. And you?
And after this moment, tell me,
What do you want? Weather...
"to try to clarify things.
Listen to me, inspector.
We could not leave for a matter of seconds, but we are "
perfectly prepared to defend ourselves,
"So try to avoid any kind of intervention."
Can i trust you Of course.
But for me to trust you you must have a gesture with me.
Free those kids from school, they are minors.
Everything will be much better that way.
But, inspector, you still haven't answered me how you're dressed.
With a gray jacket suit, a blue shirt,
"black heeled boots and ..."
Well, I think that's enough for now, right?
So I can imagine it much better.
But, inspector, a jacket suit for women
It can be skirt or pants,
"So I would ask you to come next time"
A little more concrete.
Let me think about your request.
Let's see, what kind of buzzing with 60 hostages
Does he start to hesitate to his negotiator?
-No, it's too quiet to be a buzz.
I want helicopters flying all day above his head!
No food, water or any other type of request. Is it clear?
-Excuse me, inspector.
But because I leave them without dessert, I don't think they will deliver.
Both the GEO chief here and me
We believe that immediate intervention is necessary.
-If they had wanted a butcher shop like the one in the Moscow opera,
they would have called you directly,
but unfortunately he is only here to comment and fuck.
-Please, inspector, don't get defensive.
I am here to help her.
I know you are not going through your best moment.
-If you mean menstruation, it is not the case,
But thanks for asking.
-I mean the complaint of abuse
who has interposed his ex-husband.
(Murmuring)
-Well, what good does the homework Intelligence.
There is not a single room where they do not put their noses.
-Internal matters does too.
He believes that you have filed a false complaint.
His ex-husband has remade his life
both personally and professionally within the Body,
but there are women who don't always turn the page.
-Look, I don't know if you're a miserable
or ... just a fool.
In case someone is interested in my personal life,
I have to say that it is a matter widely overcome
and is in the hands of a judge.
Thank you for your sensitivity, colonel.
(Alarm)
-A call is coming into the museum's repeater.
- Record. -Yes, we are recording.
-Turn up the volume. Silence please!
- "How come you don't come to dinner? -I'm working.
Excuse me in front of your mother and your sister.
- How do you not come? "
-He got a good one. Excuse me in front of them, but believe it.
Don't yell at me, pretty, please. -What happens?
-Well, I leave you, okay, little thing?
Come on, I love you a lot. Bye Bye.
-Short.
It is Almansa.
(Helicopters)
Why did you bring me here?
-No, calm down,
They brought me here to protect you.
Only that.
When you undress, please wear the red jumpsuit.
-Okay.
(Helicopter)
(BERLIN) Standing.
Go Go.
Take off your masks.
Take off your masks!
-What happens?
-We will be good.
We had some unforeseen,
but, despite the helicopters,
I know that they will give us some truce hours
And they can rest.
In a few minutes we will distribute sleeping bags,
Water and a sandwich. Oh, and I'm going to ask you a favor:
I want them to undress.
(MURMURAN)
-I want to distribute a red monkey like ours
So they feel more comfortable.
Sorry, sir, without annoyance.
Among these people there are patients with heart ailments,
pregnant women, diabetics, teenagers ...
I beg you, please,
Let the most vulnerable go.
I don't think they could endure this anguish all night.
-Who do you think you are, Gandhi? (BERLIN) Quiet.
Is a friend of mine. We share a great love for cinema.
(Screams and sobs)
-Get the gun.
I don't ask you if you want,
I tell you to take the gun. Take the gun. Take the gun.
And now you sign me up. No Please.
I'm telling you to sign me up.
A fucking order. Point me, pussy. Here. Esta bien.
And now you shoot me.
How? You shoot me.
Shoot me Por favor.
Please no! Or you shoot me
or I shot you I give you ten seconds.
One Two Three Four Five,
six seven eight nine...
(SCREAM)
(Firing pin)
-They're fake, Arturito, but you've done very well.
You have done it very well. I give you the gift, you can keep it.
-Now we will distribute some fake weapons.
In a few hours we will need your collaboration.
As you have seen, all you have to do is obey.
Trust us ... and obey.
Come on, get naked.
Come on.
"What is he wearing?"
Raquel, no "walkies", no mobiles, no electronic devices.
We have not tracked within any radio frequency.
-Are you telling me that they communicate with a glass of yogurt and a thread
so we don't detect them? -I don't know if it's yogurt
or they are a band of deaf and mute, but we don't find frequencies.
(Helicopters)
What the hell are those armor doing here?
-Let's go in with everything.
-That will be if I give the order.
I'm in charge and I still haven't done it.
-They are orders from above.
-Will anyone tell me what the hell is going on here
Or do I have to call the Interior Minister personally?
What the hell is going on.
-There is a person of priority 1 inside.
Do you know what is "priority 1"? -Do not.
I'm not from his intelligence gang, I don't know what it means.
They will enter. They will come in because we have our little lamb.
Alison Parker
(PRIETO) "Daughter of 'sir' Benjamin Parker, ambassador of the United Kingdom"
and close friend of the queen of England.
That's why we have no choice but to enter,
because if we don't do it now, tomorrow the whole country will know.
They will believe that we do not know. They will believe that they have managed to hide
All this information to public opinion.
(PRIETO) And today is one more hostage, but tomorrow will be his main target
and all the guns will point to your head.
Is that what you want? Hey?
That is why they will enter the first night.
And they will do it before 04:15.
Because at 06:30 it becomes day.
Can you imagine what a hostage crisis would be for Spain
managed by the United Kingdom?
And we better get in without thinking much
because that way we will have more possibilities ...
To win the first battle.
Inspector Murillo,
We're going in now and we're going to get that girl alive.
I have to talk to you...
Shut up, they'll kill us all because of you.
Looks like your boss doesn't like you, right?
How do you know who is my boss?
Because I know all of you.
I have studied it.
I have also seen the Predictor that is on your table.
And now I imagine who the father can be.
He did not like the gift.
What did he said?
What do not want to take charge?
It's not easy to say goodbye to a baby.
What are you thinking to do?
Abort.
Intervention units 1, 2 and 3, prepared.
-We will enter. -Come on!
- Come on, come on, come on! - "Teams 1, 2 and 3, prepared".
-Now.
(Sirens)
Team 1, parapeted at the front door.
Watch the roof and the high flanks.
(Phone)
And it is.
Berlin, they will enter.
Here we go.
Gentlemen, it's time!
The time has come to follow my orders!
With us.
"And that was how the State Security Forces
they did exactly what Professor
He had told us what they would do,
Only that afternoon, when he said it,
we were in the countryside and we didn't have the feeling
that we were going to get shot in the temple. "
They will enter through the four sites so you can access:
the main door, the loading area,
the emergency exit and the roof.
Keep an eye on the rear doors.
Let no one leave.
But they will wait. They will wait for the technical intervention
Make a terrain survey.
They will do that from the cargo access.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, they are already at the door.
-OKAY?
-Enter periscope.
-Come on.
-Raquel, a call is coming from a hostage's cell phone,
Alison Parker
(RADIO) "As you know, a group of kidnappers ..."
- Upload it.
(RADIO) "We have another listener on the phone to give his opinion.
-I'm not a listener. I'm a hostage and I'm kidnapped. "
My name is Alison Parker.
I am the daughter of the ambassador of the United Kingdom.
-Live, on Wave Zero. - "Call them"
from inside the Coin and Doorbell Factory.
-That cut this call immediately!
Already! Let it be cut now! - Cut the call!
-We have dressed like the kidnappers.
-Colonel, we have inner vision.
-What the fuck is that?
-We have been armed and given the same masks.
-Expand. For the. -No one knows who is who.
-Has a ground Browning machine gun.
-Sons of a bitch.
-If the Police enter, I would kill innocent people.
- Entrenched with the hostages, all dressed alike.
It is impossible to know who they are going to shoot.
-Don't get in. (RACHEL) Stop this, Suarez.
Stop it!
-Don't enter, for God's sake. (RACHEL) Stop it.
-Abandon positions. We abort operative.
-Inspector ...
- Finish what you started, Colonel.
I don't want to have anything to do with this.
"And that's how we won our first battle
on our first night,
without going into combat and common sense.
And 20 minutes later ...
we started doing what we had come to do. "
("Ninth Symphony", Beethoven)
Now play the most beautiful, now let's work.
With me:
Torres, Sánchez, Biedma,
"Lennon,
Guatsani,
Molina, Garcia,
Domingo, De Gorza, Mateo ".
Come on, pull around. "Rodrigo, Molla.
Perez. "- Come on.
(NAIROBI) Let's see, I want the machines running
24 hours, as if this were a network of pocholos.
You know, right? "Chiqui pun, chiqui pun, chiqui pun".
"Every time we stop, we lose half a million, so we won't stop."
We will make the technical corrections every three hours,
"both ink and offset."
So you know, joy, party and illusion.
"The highest paid job in history:
maybe more.
It all depended on the time we could hold inside. "
(NAIROBI) Oh my God, how wonderful, buddy!
What a wonder, "coquinoqui"!
Our money, uncle!
Fuck!
(Nairobi screams and laughs in the distance)
We are making our own pasta, logs!
(The music ends)
Can I have a decaf, please?
- "Hi. This is Marví's answering machine.
When the 'pi' sounds you can leave a message. "
(Whistle)
Mom, I just finished, it's six o'clock ...
Excuse me, won't you have a mobile charger out there?
-Do not.
Do you want to use mine?
-Really? He does not care?
Unsure?
Thank you.
I have to make a couple of calls. Nothing happens
Thank you.
"What the hell are we going to do with so much pasta?"
If we are going to steal big, dream big.
(BERLIN) I would record a record, run.
So, on the cover all my mask.
"You're not the captain of the rugby team?"
No. Athletics. Well run.
Fuck
(BERLIN) "Think well what you say, I have"
A damn polygraph here.
(ANGEL) "Everyone prevented. Be attentive to my order.
- It's a hostage. "
