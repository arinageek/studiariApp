(RADIO) "I have the kidnapper shot."
What the hell are you doing?
-There are snipers, fuck. -Get on your knees.
- "They are pointing them."
-Give me the green light! (RADIO) "They will execute them."
- "They will shoot. - I request to open fire."
(SCREAM)
- "Let's open fire. -They will kill them."
- (whispers) Green light.
-Condor three, open fire.
(SCREAM)
(Shooting)
(BREATHE BREATHINGLY)
(Fado music)
Good! Well, Mr. Torres. All right. Very good.
But now we change the series, okay?
We change lyrics, okay?
Another country, yes. You didn't scold me. Come on.
Helsinki! Go down, run
-What we have? -A seriously injured. Run Run!
You killed her, motherfuckers.
-(SHOUTS)
(SHOUTS)
(GIME)
(MOSCOW) Come on.
Water, water please.
Water please. Water.
Thank you. Arturo, hold on. River river!
(RIVER) Alcohol, alcohol.
I need you to take your hand ... (SHOUT)
-Raquel.
(TV) "Executives of the paper mill
have revealed the identity of the subject injured by the police.
It's Arturo Román, general director of the Factory,
who has just been injured by police forces,
while on the roof with the robbers.
Events have occurred when 32 hours are met
since the beginning of the kidnapping.
(GIME)
I need to talk to my wife, please.
I need to talk to my wife.
"They say that when we are at the gates of death
we are finally able to see our life clear. "
"And Arturo Román, bleeding at a table,
I expected just that: the clairvoyance of death. "
"Find out at once who had been the love of your life."
"Laura, the woman with whom I had shared 14 years
in holy marriage,
or Monica, his secretary and lover with whom he had returned
to feel youth? "
"Unfortunately, the only certainty Arturo had at that time
it was that, if they did not take out the bullet,
I was going to palmar before solving the puzzle. "
"And frankly, our first aid courses
they didn't guarantee anyone's life. "

(DENVER) Eh, stop, stop, stop.
We'll see.
Do you want us to learn medicine like that, with two markers?
If anyone is shot, they cannot go to a hospital.
You have to get in there.
It will be a damn suicide. - Shut up now, pussy.
-One thing is that we will lock ourselves in that mousetrap.
Another, that we kill each other. (BERLIN) Denver.
We are asking you to learn how to take out a bullet.
Do not start with the epic of the suburbs.
-It is not so difficult. You take the clamp, take out the bullet without fucking anything else.
-It is done. - Without fucking nothing more than a shot.
If you give me a shot, you take me to the hospital.
The answer is no".
Let's see, I prefer to be lame and free
than with a health of iron and in a cell.
No one will leave.
Any of you is a clue and a thread to pull.
If someone wants to quit, this is the time.
He stays here during the robbery and then leaves.
(RIVER) Will the talk last long?
I am running out of the pichilla like Helsinki.
-Hey! What does it say about my "pichuli"? (LAUGH)
Enough already. Enough already. Do you want to see my "pichuli"?
Please.
Get dressed, go. Oh...
Put on another one, please.
-The lollipop. Come on.
(IMPACIENT) Come on.
-Do not? No, no, no ... Well, we are.
Well ... -Come on, Nairobi.
Nothing happens either, right? Let's go, Nairobi!
(VITOREAN) But how sexy!
-It's black. (HELSINKI) Sexy, sexy.
Follow you. Oops! Okay.
Let's see what you have learned.
Well here is the carotid ... Aha.
"And so, playing doctors,
I discovered that Nairobi was more interesting than it seemed. "
The little heart
The aorta ...
"And, although nobody knew anything about anyone, ..."
Abdominal aorta
"... what I never suspected was that Nairobi had a son."
"Or a daughter."
"And that was what seemed to indicate the scar of his caesarean section."
-What do you do? Let's see, what are you doing? Eh eh!
Where are you going? -What happens?
-What are you staring at?
-What happens? Quiet
-Nerd. You are going to eat the marker.
-What happens? -That's a little tortilla.
I don't know what the hell he looks at. What are you staring at? (LAUGH)
Tortillera, you. That you put the nugget like a sugar.
Like a sugar bowl I am going to ... (VARIOUS) Hey!
Enough now!
"And there began our friendship."
(Murmurs)
(ANGEL) Rachel, Inside the phone.
What I tell them? Raquel? What do i say
Raquel! What I tell them? (RACHEL) What?
-They will ask who gave the order. -I gave the order.
Tell them that ... the wounded is a hostage.
And hang up the fucking phone! -It looked like a robber.
I asked for a green light. I insisted.
Inspector, I take responsibility with you.
-Inspector, the ambulance is ready.
Let's talk to the kidnapper.
(RADIO) "Preparing communication with the kidnapper".
(SUÁREZ) A decision had to be made. They were already ...
They seemed to be executed, you had to decide, there was no time.
-Silence please!
(Ringtone)
(Phone)
Teacher?
"They have fired on the hostages."
"There is one between life and death. I guess he calls for that."
I have the ambulance to transfer the injured.
No one is going to get out of here.
That man is bleeding. "For the bullet fired by you."
Will they let him die?
"Let me target a medical team."
Professor ... look.
I know the mistake has been mine,
"But if a hostage dies, it will be the same for you as it is for me."
"Because I assure you in less"
five minutes all public opinion will know
that man has died
because he has not allowed us to enter to save his life.
(INSPIRE)
"Two surgeons and a nurse with surgical equipment."
"Let me know when they arrive." Thank you.
"I also have something to ask for."
The wounded wants to talk to his wife.
Of course.
(Call ended)
Fuck.
Locate Mr. Román's wife.
How long can we have the medical team here?
-By helicopter from La Paz,
- Bring them. Already! -Okay.
(NERVOUS BREATH)
(JADEA)
(Sirens)
(AGENT) Everyone to your posts, come.
Please, everyone in their posts.
- (SOCKS)
Sorry.
Can drive?
-Yes Yes.
-I need to get out of here, take a walk.
-Yes. -Thank you.
(ANGEL) Hey, Rachel.
What happens?
-I have to think.
-Start.
(Siren)
Do not look at me like that. I will not leave you alone.
Where the fuck is it?
-The daughter of a bitch has escaped!
Let's see...
(Mobile)
Go, go
There we are.
(WILL TAKE THE MOBILE SONG)
Tell me daughter
"Are you going to be able to come to sleep tonight?"
- (SOCKS) I don't know, mom. - "But why? Does something happen?"
-Mom, it's ...
Am...
I have committed
"a very serious mistake at work".
-Daughter, is that your job is very difficult.
"Come on, tell me, because there is nothing"
It seems so serious five minutes after telling.
-I was drinking wine with ...
- "That seems good to me. With whom?"
Do i know him
-No, mom. I don't know him or me.
The question is ... When I have returned to the tent,
there was a very serious situation,
"of risk, on the roof of the Factory and ...
I thought one of the hostages was in danger, "
so I have given ...
shoot order.
And the shot was taken by an innocent.
-Yes Yes. If I saw it on TV, daughter.
-"And now I do not know what to do".
I don't know whether to call his wife,
Give a press release, resign. I don't know what to do, mom.
-Well, to start, stay calm and don't blame yourself.
"Aren't they there with masks and guns,"
locked up, all scrambled?
You just wanted to protect the hostages, right?
"Daughter ... What if you had saved someone's life?"
That? Right now you wouldn't be calling me on the phone, right?
"Good...,
and neither..."
I would have learned in passing that you stay with strangers
"to drink rods".
- (BALBUCEA) By God. What ... I don't meet strangers.
- Have you kissed?
-How am I going to kiss him? If I don't know him.
-Bah ... Know him ... Know him, what nonsense.
The beautiful thing is the crush.
Daughter, we have so little time in this life ...
-Well, mom, but now that's not the point.
The point is that I am in a critical work situation.
-Daughter, well, fuck that job of yours.
"Why don't you ask to have your passports sealed
and so you enjoy a little? Caramba!".
"Or do you think tomorrow
you will be hand in hand with the kidnapper "
in a nursing home? No, daughter, no.
But, likewise, with that stranger ...
"(LAUGHS) Yes, you laugh, but I know very well what I say. I've been ..."
Time does not stop, daughter.
And it doesn't go back either, you know?
(DRIVER) Entering the perimeter. -I'll think about it, mom.
And you, if you see that I don't arrive, lie down, okay?
-Okay.
-Hey, and lie down
"with someone too".
(DENVER, BETWEEN TEETH) Fuck ...
Monica Eh, uh ... Eh.
What are you doing here? You are crazy?
I was not very well.
I think it's the medications that didn't sit me far there.
-The drugs.
That will be, the medications. Yes, my daughter. That will be.
My mother, it's boiling like a coffee maker.
-You have to get her out of here throwing hosts.
-Do I help you. Wait wait.
Can you ... leave me alone
one moment? Yes.
Please.
(DENVER RESOLVES)
How do you see her?
-I don't see her very Catholic.
I see her badly.
If we don't take that bullet out, it's going to be taken for the ass.
-Dad, calm down, huh?
It will get well.
-Why did you shoot him, pussy?
-Because Berlin was going to kill her.
I could not do otherwise.
-Motherfucker.
If he wants to kill someone who pulls the trigger, not you.
We have come to steal, right?
Not to kill someone. Not to save lives.
Fuck, we are miserable, pussy.
He has to touch us ... -Dad, calm down.
Quiet.
(Tank)
Monica, are you done yet?
Yes.
(GIME OF PAIN)
Come on. -Raquel, wait a moment.
I want to talk to you.
I want to enter infiltrated with the medical team.
-Do not. Someone will come in, but not you.
-Oh, sure. There is always someone better for everything, right?
Raquel, I am an expert in firearms.
I can get in there and, at a glance, know how many they have,
which are and if they are false or not.
We can know who the robbers are.
-You're right.
You will accompany me and cover the doctors.
And now I tell you what we will do.
I've heard a shot before.
(DENVER) The police.
He has shot a hostage.
A hostage? Yes.
To who?
To who?
Who has the police shot at?
-At the head of the Factory.
Arturo?
Has the police killed Arturo?
-Do not. He has not killed him.
It's okay? Yes.
Its alive?
Is Arturo okay? It's okay. Yes.
Insurance? Insurance.
It's okay? A surgeon will enter.
With his team.
They will operate on you and you will be saved, okay?
Are you going to have surgery? Yes.
You have to tell him that I am alive.
Arturo, you have to tell him.
Do you hear me? -Here nobody will say anything to anyone.
Because you're going to get well and he too, okay?
Come on. Let's see that wound.
Quiet.
It is going to believe that it was all because of him.
I picked up the phone because he asked for it.
And now I'm dead because of him.
You must tell him that I am alive, okay?
And his son too.
You are pregnant?
Very good.
(TARTAMUDEA) Congratulations.
Give me a pen, please. -Okay.
When?
Thank you.
Angel!
Let them know that I have made the decision to enter.
I will take advantage of medical intervention to do so.
-I celebrate these decisions that you take on an ambulance ride.
But my presence responds only to the Government's desire
that there is no violent outcome.
-Well.
How pacifist has suddenly become the CNI.
Weren't you the one who wanted to enter yesterday with the tanks?
-I wanted to surprise you. End this as soon as possible.
But now the priority is zero victims.
So my advice is to negotiate and wait.
-It has to be really screwed to be here all day
believing more than anyone, without making a single decision, right?
The conflict of the hostage crisis.
-Inspector, I will not enter the rag
because I understand that at a certain age
The hormones take over in there.
I know for my mother.
(RACHEL) Where are you going?
-As you understand, I have to report all this, right?
-Of course.
So far the kidnappers are ahead of us always.
They had everything planned.
Less this shot.
It is the first thing that comes out of your plan.
And we have to take advantage of it.
(RACHEL) The only way to get in without your cameras being detected
is to advance through this subsoil tube
It leads directly to the basements.
It is the ventilation nozzle.
- It was added seven months ago to release heat from the press.
The work is in process.
They probably don't know its existence.
-I need two of your men to come in here.
Officer García Lobo, here, and I will go with him.
-Good. The blond subinspector
"He will accompany the two surgeons and enter as a nurse."
18:09.
All in time.
"At 18:15 the medical team will enter."
"According to the head of Internal Medicine
the operation will not last more than 30 minutes. "
But they can extend it exactly until 19:00.
The exit of the doctors
It will concentrate a greater number of kidnappers to monitor them.
Moment in which Suárez and Lobo will enter through the subsoil.
"They will access through the basement box
dressed in red overalls and Dalí masks. "
They will infiltrate with the hostages.
We will only succeed if we work with the precision of a watch.
-Inspector!
Arturo Román's wife. -One moment, please.
Suarez, on the move.
Take care of the doctors. And be careful.
(AGENT) We prepare operational!
-What happened? Is my husband okay?
-Your husband is conscious and stable.
It has been shot down by mistake.
-Dejected? How dejected? -He is hurt, but alive.
Quiet. Quiet.
The kidnappers allow us to put a surgical team
and will be intervened immediately.
-Sorry, but ... I didn't even listen to her, I'm sorry.
-Quiet.
Everything will work out, okay?
Sit down please. -Thank you.
- Can you talk to him right now? -Yes.
-Put this on.
Almansa, record!
(Phone)
"Yes?".
Professor, Arturo Román's wife is here.
OK.
(Whispers) That bullet must be taken out now.
-Do it, dad.
That you have more cold blood.
-Where is the kit of operations that the professor gave us?
There is a scalpel. - Berlin has it.
Fuck.
I don't think it's a good idea to ask him, right?
-The surgeons! Go steal the instruments. Run.
-Okay. Wait! Wait!
Give it the note, please.
-Now I'm going to wash your wound, okay?
Quiet. You're going to get well, okay?
Arthur. Arthur!
What is your wife's name?
Laura
What a nice name. Well, you can talk to Laura.
Wives are good for these moments.
They are comforting.
No one remembers his wife when he is at the door
from the disco set to the bars, but ...
If you have a problem, an accident or ... just fear ...
The thing changes.
Won't you remember your secretary now?
Hey? Yes?
Do not.
But who remembers now lovers
with children that could be abortions ...
or just nothing? Save me the speech, will you?
Listen to me.
If you say something weird, I'll give you a coup de grace
and your wife will listen live.
Can you imagine? (GIME OF PAIN)
Inspector!
They are turning on a phone.
-You have to intervene that phone.
I want to see the selfi and main cameras.
There there.
"Hi dear".
Arturo, honey, how are you?
Well well. I'm fine.
"The shot has been clean." -There is no image.
Neither self nor main camera. They have covered them.
"They are going to let some surgeons in now."
(LAURA) I already know.
Look, I wear ...
I've been thinking about you and ...
And in everything we've done wrong.
Don't think about that, honey. Not now.
"Not now".
Besides, the fault is mine.
I know that we are not well. That we have not been well for some time.
That I have neglected you and the boys.
That I have been selfish.
I promise you that all that will change, can you hear me?
"I promise you it will change."
"You've been saying you want to see for ten years
to your sister to Australia. "
Take the opportunity for children to learn English.
And meet the kangaroos.
"Well, it's the first thing we'll do when we go out."
I owe.
I will do it for you.
For how much I love you.
Every year wasted chasing ...
Thinking that the only important thing was money and position and ...
"When the only important thing is you."
"It has always been you."
From the day I met you.
I swear there are times that ...
I try to remember that day ...
"And I wonder what the hell you saw in me, Monica."
Laura
Now just think about getting out of there.
"Just think about that."
"I love you."
I love you my love.
-It's okay?
Quiet.
-What boards do you have, Arturo.
To your secretary ... with the hype ...
Laurita waiting for you in the 4x4 with the children.
You, surrounded by money, are a legend.
(NAIROBI) Berlin!
The doctors are out there!
(BERLIN) You'll have to apologize.
Does everyone know what they should do? -They know! Of course they know!
(SCREAM) Are you ready?
(Murmur)
Well, they are ready.
-Mercedes!
Are you ready?
-Yes sir. -I want her out of here.
Rio, take her to an office.
Nairobi.
-We wear the masks!
And with me! Rock And Roll!
(Alarm)
Come in.
Leave everything on the floor.
Close doors.
(Alarm)
Advance
Hands on the head and legs open.
We are going to frisk you.
- Accompany the gentleman, please.
"Listen to me".
One of the toilets is an infiltrated policeman.
Which? The one with the glasses.
You know what to do.
Perfectly. Go for it. Berlin!
It has to be a damn goldsmith's job.
I know.
Sirs!
The one with the glasses is the policeman.
They will enter.
I don't know if during an assault, during an emergency ...
If it will be that of the Red Cross or that of the pizzas,
but what is clear is that they are going to try to infiltrate someone.
And that will be our opportunity
to try to place a Trojan horse.
Do you know what it is?
No, I know but rhyming is easy. Do not!
The Trojan horse ... What comes out of my cock!
- That you shut up and concentrate on a damn time!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
The Greeks were at war with the Trojans.
One day the Trojans found at the gates of their city
A wooden horse. A huge wooden horse!
And, driven by their vanity, they thought it was a gift of surrender
by the Greeks. So they opened the doors ...
And they put it inside.
What they didn't know is that this horse was hollow.
And full of Greek warriors.
That night the Trojans lost the war.
And it is exactly what we are going to do.
When they try to enter
and think they are winning the battle ...
(BERLIN) Deposit all your metal objects in that tray.
Glasses.
Watches
If they have weapons ...
micros ... I also advise you to deposit them.
We will track any type of radio frequency.
Take off your shoes too. Please.
And now lie down.
Down.
That's.
Cockroach mode (LAUGHS)
Standing.
Put on your shoes.
Take only the glasses.
He will need them.
(BERLÍN) "And now ... Welcome. Take your things and join me."
"Thank you".
(Door)
That?
(ALISON) Sometimes people like you come on TV.
- How I what?
-Attractors.
But you don't add up much. You see that this is not your thing.
-Why?
-How you take the gun.
-I thought you were the ambassador's daughter, not Rambo.
-Well, my father always wanted to have a son
and since I'm five years old it takes me to shoot shots.
- To hit shots?
To what?
To the chopsticks of the fair?
-A wild boar, red deer,
antelope...
But what my father would like is to hunt environmentalists.
But I don't like guns.
Once in Norwich ...
a friend of my father was shot.
I saw everything.
The shot in the back, people screaming ...
It's like when...
you see an accident on the road and you have the ...
The blood stain
-Good...
It's downloaded, okay?
Do not be afraid.
(Intermittent beep)
How do you see it, doctor?
Will I get out of this?
(DOCTOR) The bullet is housed ...
in the clavicle
It does not affect vital organs
and they are not perceived either ...
bone chips
No one is going to die of this.
(DENVER) To the mess.
"Denver didn't have time for diagnoses."
-Anesthesia. "Monica was bleeding."
"If I didn't steal the scalpel soon,
having forgiven his life would not have been of any use. "
(BERLIN) What anesthesia will you put in?
-In setbacks, total sedation is preferable.
(BERLIN) No.
Better put a local anesthetic.
So my friend Arturo and I can chat
during the intervention, huh, Arturito?
(LAUGHS)
(SCREAM) -Quiet, quiet.
(SCREAM) (DOCTOR) Ok, ok, now.
(DENVER) What watch is it for?
-It is to control the duration of local anesthesia, 25 minutes.
If there is any inconvenience during the intervention,
We should give him another dose.
Put the clock on the screen.
"That operation was scheduled
and it had to last exactly 25 minutes he had ordered
the inspector. "
"That countdown would leave two police officers with Dalí masks
inside the factory
or, if it went wrong, two bodies in the ventilation ducts. "
Drop the fucking rifle.
It's unloaded, release it before it pisses me off.
-The chamber bullet.
Suarez, can you copy me?
-Clean tube.
"We are moving towards the goal."
Turn around and put your hands on the back of the neck.
Come on!
-Come on!
Come on.
What happens? You're not that tough anymore, huh?
Come on, pussy, come on!
Shoot.
Tare breeding whore. On knees!
Scalpel.
-For, I distribute the weapons here.
Scalpel.
(BERLIN) You've been crowned before, huh, Arturo?
Changing the name of your wife.
Of course, that is normal.
Fornicating in the morning with Monica,
spending the afternoon with Laura ...
It is normal for you to get confused.
But I love them both.
That's the truth.
When you are in my situation, it is very easy to judge everyone.
Think you're a scoundrel,
A son of the great whore.
(BERLIN) God frees me from making moral judgments.
I can understand everything.
With me you can talk quietly about anything.
But I'm really a bastard
a poor man who is in love with two women
And he doesn't have enough eggs to choose one.
Why the hell did you do that?
-I do not know, sorry.
I'm sorry.
-Down!
You are 11 meters from the entrance. (SUÁREZ) "Received."
We continue.
(RIVER) Fucking fucking little girl, fucking cock!
-I'm sorry. - That you shut the fucking mouth!
Don't tell me your life, okay?
I'm not the fucking friend of the marginalized, is that clear to you?
If you are begging for friendship that has kidnapped you,
You are so screwed.
You know what...?
That I am only six weeks pregnant and ...
I am more concerned with the life of the child than mine?
It takes more than an infection
so that children don't go out to eat the world, woman.
Hey, what's your name?
Moscow, they call me Moscow.
Hey, Moscow,
And how is it ...
what about ...?
Well, about being a father.
Be dad...
Well, look, being a father is that you fall like that all at once
a car of problems and also for a lifetime.
Come on, what is to be worried the rest of your days.
First, the baby colds.
That is every weekend in the ER
instead of going for drinks.
I don't care, I don't drink.
Well worse for you because you don't know how good a Pacharán feels
when you leave him there asleep in his crib.
And then the school.
The fear...
that we have parents that ...
That your son is not the fool and the host bag of his class.
Come on, what is bullying now.
What happens is that in my case ...
It was my son who caned.
Every two by three they expelled me.
I don't know how many schools we spend that ...
And then his mother, the poor one, who had his trade ...
Well, how poor or poor?
He left me alone, lying there like ...
At the foot of the canyon.
Because in the end all you want is ...
make it normal
that does not stay in the corner smoking Chinese
instead of going to the institute.
But being a father ...
it's okay. It is very ...
Hey no, no! Monica, don't fall asleep!
Look at me, look at me! Do not sleep, honey.
Come look at me! -Dad!
-That's. -What happens?
What happens? -Nothing is fine.
-Yes? - (whispers) You have too much fever.
No, don't stop looking at me. Let's see, look at me, that is.
-I bring it all.
(RACHEL) "Five minutes for doctors to leave."
-It is understood.
-I got it.
Thank you.
(BERLIN) And now you sew.
-Who me?
-If you.
You're a nurse, right?
-Yes Yes. -Well that.
-It is local anesthesia.
We put it in the wound and in a step ... without pain.
I go.
-Come on, let me, I already do it.
Stay tuned for the pulse. -Okay.
-Come on, let's go ... That's it, go, go.
-Do you know what I'm going to do when ... when I get out of here?
I will study at a distance.
-You haven't studied in your life.
-I don't tell you to do Medicine, but yes ...
Yes, take it back where I left it, you know?
-This one is going to hurt a little more, okay?
Look look. Oh! - (NERVOUS LAUGHTER)
-Already.
Ok, that's it.
-It is done. -It is done.
Now in five minutes it takes effect and ...
And we start to open, okay?
Come on. Okay.
(Whistle)
You are two meters from the entrance. -We visualize objective.
Let's see...
I feel a little bad. I think I'm going to vomit.
(BERLIN) Are you a nurse, dancer or what the hell is wrong with you?
-I am a nurse,
But I'm not used to work surrounded by weapons.
-Well, okay now. I sew.
But I want everyone in silence, please.
(BERLIN) Come on, let's go.
-Gripper.
(HELSINKI) The Professor wants to talk to you.
(BERLIN) Very good. Accompany the nurse to the bathroom to vomit.
If he doesn't, you put his head in the toilet until he does.
Do you hear me? Until he does.
Goodbye, Arturo.
-Goes.
Come on.
Come on.
They broadcast in shortwave and encrypted, so they are entering,
But I don't know where.
Ear, active plan B.
"Activate it and take out the medical equipment now."
Already.
"My love, be strong. I'm fine. I love you. Monica."
What the fuck do you want? I do not know? I've seen that before and ...
And it has caught my attention.
I didn't know what it was.
Sorry. Ok, sorry.
Hala, until "luegui".
What do you do?
Do you want to pyrar? I don't want palique.
How old are you?
Your son.
Seven.
It has seven.
Where is?
With his father?
With his father? With his father no. He has never been with his father.
Nothing is known about his father.
What is your name?
Axel
His name is Axel.
It means "ax."
Ax. Yes.
Because it is an ax. Already...
Like his mother.
That boy is a survivor, you know?
It has survived everything.
It's like a cork of those in the middle of the sea
They don't sink.
This is him.
With three years ...
I had to take it from my mother's house
because her husband ...
I gave him anise when I wasn't there because it bothered him to cry.
So I took it.
The two alone, without needing anything family.
He and I.
And we were fucking mother.
But I screwed up.
One day...
I had to go for some pills to sell.
Y...
And I left him alone.
Five minutes.
It was going to be five minutes, huh?
And I mess
with the fucking Spiderman of the balls.
I crap on Spiderman!
Because he wanted to be a superhero he said.
I climbed everything. I climbed that you don't see.
And he went out to the terrace through the window.
Then he picked up a chair, climbed into the chair
and started: "Mommy!"
"Mommy!".
I was three and a half years old.
Of course, at five minutes
I had a police patrol there, the firemen ...
To all God.
They caught me with the pills,
with background,
no job
For the train.
Then my child began to move from family to host family,
from hand to hand.
And nothing to me.
Nothing, huh?
They didn't leave me a visit or a call ...
Any.
Then I got out of jail ...
and nothing.
They did not give it to me.
Have you seen it again?
They will not let me.
Of course ...
I know where it is, huh?
Oh yeah? It is in the Canary Islands.
He is with a family that has a hotel.
It's okay.
Are you going for him?
I'm going to take it ...
and end point.
The other side of the world.
I'm going to tell you something, look.
In this robbery
I'm not going to screw it up
because he who goes out of the pot, shattered his life.
Of all the plans that people have around here,
yours...
is the best.
And I'm going to tell you something else ...
Do you like tequila?
(Music)
(THEY SING)
It's 4:03 in the morning.
Tomorrow there is class early.
Plastic explosive
Sorry.
It would be great if you were resting for class.
We have revealed. To the bed.
The three to bed? Each to his own.
That pajamas suits you, Professor.
Now.
Now.
(LAUGH)
And you ... And you with the lights.
To me this guy puts me a lot, puts me a lot.
It puts me a lot! Really? Well, you don't notice anything.
Does it show me?
Mogollón Well, I noticed.
What a dizziness, kid!
"Subinspector Angel knew in a thousandth of a second
that they had lost another battle. "
"Those sinister masks meant they were going to take
to two men to the lions. "
"Also that the guy who had devised that robbery
I had more intelligence and more imagination than the police,
the CNI and the Intervention Unit,
and when they get ahead of you like that,
it's time to run. "
We have to leave now.
-Miss, please, we're done now.
Can we go please?
-Yes. -Yes?
-Quietly.
They follow me.
(BERLIN) Doctor, doctor!
Just a moment.
One minute, 30 seconds.
(Interferences)
What happens? -There are frequency inhibitors.
-Suárez, can you copy me?
They have put frequency inhibitors.
I think we will lose communication.
(RACHEL, CONCERNED) "Can you copy me?"
-There are inhibitors.
We lose communication.
-Suárez ...
(BERLIN) How was the intervention?
-Well, but we would have to return in 24 hours.
-I appreciate the interest, but for the postoperative period
We have enough prepared people.
My friend the nurse ... Are you feeling better?
-Yes, yes, thanks.
-I'm glad.
Sorry I didn't accompany you, but I leave you in good hands.
Goodbye.
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.
(BERLIN) Send our greetings abroad!
Did you tell Arturo that I'm fine?
(DENVER) Eh?
Did you tell Arturo that I'm alive?
Yes ... I didn't tell him. Did you tell him or not?
I gave him the note. Ah ...
And what did he say?
Fuck, he went crazy. He went crazy, what will he say?
Whats Next.
Than...
That he loves you very much ... And what else?
Said...
That when you leave this, it takes you to Australia.
To Australia?
Yes.
-I do not see her.
-He also said he doesn't know what you saw to look at him.
To Australia? Yes, to Australia.
It is the dream destiny of his wife.
Besides, Arturo knows I'm afraid of airplanes.
What happens? That came in, right?
Did your wife go to the doctors?
Was Laura here? Do not.
Yes. He told her on the phone.
Suarez! - Command post, can you copy me?
Command post, do you copy me?
(Interferences)
Shit.
(AGENT) Inspector, surgeons are dating.
(ANGEL whispers) Don't stop.
Do not stop.
Run, run now. Run now Run now! Come on!
"Let's go outside!".
Angel comes running. Something has happened.
(ANGEL) Abort! The masks have been changed.
They don't go from Dalís. They go straight to the slaughterhouse.
(RACHEL) What?
Attention, abort entry.
Suarez, can you copy me?
Objective reached.
We proceed to remove cover and we are already inside.
(NAIROBI) What do you do?
-A bullet.
A gunshot wound.
-Ay ay ay! Oh, Moscow! You are doing a scallop!
Bring, give me! "Then something unexpected happened."
"Nairobi put all his effort and meticulousness to the service
of the common good. "
"Instead of giving them away, he helped Moscow save Monica's life."
-I'm going to take a little air.
"Or at least his leg." (NAIROBI) The mother who bore you!
"She had not come to kill anyone."
(NAIROBI) Fuck, come on! "And as I told you before,
I was not willing to let anything screw up Professor’s plan. "
Suarez, can you copy me? The masks have changed.
-There are interferences.
Command post, do you receive me? I do not hear you.
-They don't wear Dalí's mask! Fuck, it's a fucking suicide.
"Attention, do you copy me?"
Abort entry, repeat, abort entry!
-We proceed to take out weapons and we are inside.
-Abortad entrance! Abort entrance!
(INTERRUPTED) "It's an order!"
"The masks have changed. They don't wear Dalí masks."
"Attention, do you copy me?"
"Abort entrance!"
