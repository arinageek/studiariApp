Welcome.

And you too.
You can be too.
Every human being has great potential
It develops through physical conditioning.
Yes! But, even more important,
through mental evolution
and spiritual
You can also develop that potential.
But don't expect miracles!
The only miracle lies in its own will.
And remember, mental development
is the engine
for physical development
Then...
...an act.
[all] Oh!
This act requires an absolute physical and mental concentration.
Only lamas
and the great martial arts masters
and some great athletes
They have been able to do it.

If you. Come.
Sell ​​me your eyes, please.
Make sure they are well covered.
You have enough bandage.
Thank you. Go to your place.

[Fermin] What was there, Wolf?
- [Wolf] How are you, Fermin? - [Fermin] Good.
- How did you feel the training? - Heavy.
How about the new trainers?
- That Korean knows a lot, doesn't he? - Yes.
It's heavy.
[Fermin] Haven't you noticed that?
[Wolf] What he says about fitness is true.
Fermin!
Can you talk a little bit?
- [young] Hey, they talk to you! - Sh!
Ale!
Hi my cleo.
Hi Fermin.
What brings you through these directions?
I have left you errands, I have looked for you and you are not right.
Sorry, but the training became very intense.
They even brought a gringo coach and a Korean one.
Well, the gringo was already here, but the Korean is new.
Is it for the Olympics?
Something like that.
Who told you I was here?
Is that my neighbor's brother-in-law trains here with you.
- It was Ramón. - No.
Click fat.
But wherever you see it, your little warmer to the fucking.
Chin Chin.
I am with order.
And me?
It is that the creature is yours.
No way!
It is that it is.
I already told you no mothers.
And if you don't want your fucking mother to break you
you and your little creature, don't say it again.
And don't look for me again.

[Sofia sobbing]
[Sofia] No, I ate. Yes, he went to Acapulco with that lollipop.
For that he does have money, right?
Since he left he has not sent a fifth.
And it's going to be six months.
He says he is very short, that he has no money to send them.
Ah, but now he gave him a dive.
All equipment is being purchased.
How much do you think that costs? But for that it does, doesn't it?
[Sofia sobbing]
I did not eat.
He sends letters. Dizque from Quebec.
- Nothing, pure slugs that invents them. - [Cleo] Paco!
That the landscape is very beautiful, that there are many animals ...
[Cleo] Paco!
... who misses them a lot but can't come
because his research is being delayed, he has ...
He has no pants to tell them ... Pure lies!
[Sofia continues to sob]
[Cleo] Andale, Paco.
[Sofia] Yes, comadre, don't worry, I'll mark you later.
[Cleo] Paco, come.
And what are you spying on me? Hey?
Oh, sorry, my love! Sorry!
[both crying]
And why do you leave it? Fuck! Why do you leave it?
[Sofia] Sorry, my love, sorry.
What are you doing standing there? Don't you have something better to do?
Get out!
Don't say anything to your brothers, please.
- Do not tell. - I don't tell them.
[Paco] Why?
[Sofia] Sorry.
[Pepe] You're beating him for two laps! Three laps!
It happened to you, Paco!
[Paco] No, but I'm beating him for two laps.
[Pepe] But I want to play!

Are you going to get in?
No my love. I have to go check the car tires
because tomorrow we leave early. They want to come?
No. It's our last day at the beach.
Well, but if I leave, they can't get in.
Cleo can't swim if something happens.
- If it's very soft. - No, I do not care.
If they want to stay, that's the rule.
- On the shore? - Well, on the shore yes. But only there.
- And it is! - Can I too, mommy?
Yes, my love, but only at the edge, huh?
Will I leave you for a little while? I will not be long.
[Cleo] Nothing else on the shore!
Come, there it is clean.
Paco, your mom already said! If not, they leave.
Sofi! Paco! On the shore!
[seagulls squawking]
Paco!
Did you know that when I was older I was a sailor?
AHA.
Yes, but one day I drowned in a storm.
And the waves were very big!
Sofi! Paco! On the shore!
And it was night. There were many rays. And I didn't know how to swim.
Wait here.
Paco! More here!
Sofi!
Help your sister!
Sofi!
Paco!
Paco!
Paco!
Sofi!
Sofi!
Sofi!
Sofi!
[Sofi coughing]
[Sofi continues to cough]
What happened? Are you OK my love?
You're good?
Cleo saved us.
Thank you.
You're good?
Thank you.
I did not love her.
[Cleo sobbing]
Que?
I did not love her.
They are fine.
I didn't want him to be born.
[both sobbing]
We love you so much, Cleo.
True?
Poor dear.
We love you. A lot.
[Sofi coughs]
[thunder rumbling]
I love you so much, Cleo.
I love you too.
[war band playing]
[Pepe] Mom, I have to go to the bathroom quickly.
[Sofia] Now yes! Run it!
[buzzing bell]
Hey, Toño, Sofi, Paco, help me! Don't be done
[Pepe] Hi, Borras.
- [Toño] Hi, Adela. - Hi.
- [Sofi] Hi, Adela. - Hi kids.
- [Paco] Hi, Adela. - Welcome.
- Hi, Adela. - Hi, ma'am. Welcome.
- I leave you here? - Yes ma'am.
It's horrible.
Without bookshelves it is horrible.
[Paco] I like it better that way.
[Toño] It's horrible.
[toilet downloading]
- [Sofi] What's awful, mommy? - He doesn't like the hall without the bookshelves.
- [Sofi] What booksellers? - Those who were there.
- [I'll make dinner. ] - Now low.
[ I have a lot to tell you. ]
- [Sofia] How was the adventure? - [Paco] Very good!
- Hello son. How did it go? Tell me. - [Paco] They changed the rooms.
- Where is mine? - There, my love.
- Why did they change them? - Because it's prettier like that.
- I liked the other one more. - Well, check it, let's see what you think.
- How did it go? - Sofi and Paco almost drowned me.
Hi Cleo. Mrs. Sofi's room is that.
Thank you.
- Hi. - Hello my love.
[Sofia] Well, go see Grandma's and mine, see how it goes.
- Cleo, come see the room. - Right now I'm going, yes?
[Sofi] Wow! This one is bigger! It looks bigger.
[Cleo] Yes, it has a lot of light.
[phone ringing]
[Sofia] And we will have more adventures. And we will travel a lot.
[Sofi] He's going to be a father!
Okay?
- Hi, ma'am. - Hi, how are you, Cleo?
Well thanks. Yes, right now I pass it.
- [Sofi] Yes, go to the town of Cleo. - Yes, when they like.
- Mrs. Sofi, Mrs. Molly speaks to you. - Oh thank you.
Let's see, tell me, how could they drown?
Yes, the current took us.
Hi, I ate. Good very good.
[Toño] Of course not! They were two meters.
[Sofi] Cleo saved us. Right Cleo?
- Cleo, can you bring me a banana smoothie? - And it is.
- Me too. - Are there Gansitos?
Right now I check.
Yes, there is a box in the freezer that I bought.
[kids chatting]
[ Wait. ] Where are you going?
- [To buy ham. ] - [ I have a lot to tell you. ]
- [ You had fun? ] - [ If much. ]
[I want you to tell me everything. It doesn't take long. ]
[Just go for the ham. Nothing to go with the boyfriend. ]
[Adela laughs]
