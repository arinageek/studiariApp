Can I have a decaf, please?
"Hi, this is Mariví's answering machine.
When the pi sounds, you can leave a message. "
(Whistle)
Mom, I just finished. They are...
Excuse me, won't you have a mobile charger out there?
-Do not.
Do you want to use mine?
You really don't care? Nerd.
Insurance? Thank you.
I have to make a couple of calls.
Nothing happens. Thank you.
Mom, I just finished, I'm going there.
"Commissioner Sánchez, leave your message."
I'm Inspector Murillo. I know it is late,
but I wanted to tell you that if this leads Intelligence
for I don't know what kinds of diplomatic interests,
I'm not going to be your straw inspector while those gorillas
They get in there with everything. I would love to be more elastic
and lower my panties every time that Prieto crows,
but I have no stomach, so I find myself in the obligation ...
to resign. Goodnight.
Good Morning.
Thank you. You are welcome.
Sorry, but you are ...
Are you...
"If I started telling the story of a kidnapping,
it's because everyone will remember those siege days
at the National Currency and Stamp Factory.
The downtown streets were closed, it was broadcast live 24 hours,
the police burned their academy manuals
and he didn't know how to take the toast in the sun
of those unfortunates trying to print
his own money, but many other things happened
that nobody remembers, things that changed us all
to the point of not knowing who the bad guys were ...
and who the good ones. "
Excuse me, when do you negotiate with these people,
they give them what they ask for or they follow the chatter
to save time or ...?
Well, don't answer me, just ... Each case is different.
Sure, forgive me, forgive me.
But...
But well, yes, we try to temper the mood
and save time.
Thank you.
"In reality we won the time,
the phrase that time is money was never better applied.
And what about money.
Every hour we printed eight million euros,
of the ones we cut
Everything was so placid at that time of dawn
It seemed that the plan was on wheels.
The Professor was our Big Brother,
controlled the police radio and 18 cameras,
so if someone wanted to fuck us, we would know
well in advance.
We took turns watching the hostages,
the accesses and of course the production.
Only 20 hours of being there the press had already spit
so at that time we all thought it was possible.
But all that peace was just the calm chicha
that precedes the storm, things were going to fuck so much
that we were going to be very close to losing the game.
And if you ask me why,
I will say that for a simple love story.
After all, love is a good reason
so that all things fail. "
(WOMAN) "Daughter, I know you don't like Paula sleeping in your bed,
but he has been determined and did not want to fight her.
Do not be angry.
He has also insisted on pasta and melon dinner.
I know he is a little indigestible, he still wakes you up. "
"Daughter, it's two o'clock. The girl has woken up
and he has vomited a little, next time I don't give him melon.
She is already asleep, she has told me she is very nervous.
Remember tomorrow is your birthday. "
I would like to ask you a favor.
Can be?
(RADIO) "There is movement, all prevented."
Deputy inspector, they are opening the doors.
- "There are seven men armed with M-16, sir."
-All the world prevented, attentive to my order.
Let no one do anything, okay?
-It is a unique opportunity. -That nobody do anything.
Take off the mask.
I ask you, please, not to shoot.
My name is Monica Gaztambide.
It is a hostage.
I just come to read a statement.
I speak to you on behalf of the robbers.
The situation is as follows: we are 67 hostages,
all in perfect health and well taken care of.
There are no victims or injured. We are all dressed the same
and it’s impossible to distinguish ourselves from robbers,
so any assault attempt
it can cost a lifetime ... (RADIO) "El Dalí with megaphone
You are giving him orders, sir, he can be one of the robbers. "
They wanted to take money that was not yet from anyone.
(RADIO) "Attention, all units alert".
- "Target shot, awaiting instructions".
... will tell the press the whole truth about the negotiation,
both requests that are accepted
like the ones that don't.
(POLICE) "I request green light, sir."
-Quiet, still everyone, okay? Still
They regret the wounded policeman and wait with all their heart
Let him recover.
- "The one with the megaphone, sir, is a robber."
- I request green light, sir.
- "Target shot.
They are entering, last chance, sir.
Last chance, sir.
They are entering, I repeat, they are entering. "
-No, nobody shoot.
Nobody shoots, have you heard me? Let them in,
let them in again. Have you heard me? Let them in.
- "As we have just witnessed, the robbers have given a statement
in which they feel they have hurt the police. "
It seems that the hostages are in perfect condition
"and the assailants have no intention of using violence."
- Come, ladies, a little brio in the morning, and deworming.
Come on, shoot for the museum, for the museum, pull.
Come on man.
Oh, Helsin.
# I want pasta, pasta. You want pasta, pasta.
# We want pasta, pasta. And I want pasta, pasta. #
Oh god Helsin.
Helsin, the one we are bundling, chick.
Do you know what we are doing? Do you know now
everybody, all the press, all the newspapers, the radio
He is going to talk about us because we are heroes,
because nobody has done this?
(BERLIN) I'm going to tell you the truth. We are locked
and we really don't know how long this can last,
but as long as they don't blow my head, I'm going to take care of you.
As long as they don't try to fool me ...
or communicate with the outside,
everything will be fine.
If you have any heroic concerns, I advise you to forget it.
There are more pleasant ways to fall in love
to your coworkers.
From now on we will organize,
We are going to assign some tasks so they don't get depressed.
What is your name? -Paul.
-You do sports?
-Eh ... Yes, I'm a college athletic captain.
- Take a step forward, Captain.
A step forward.
Man. (LAUGHS)
Arturito
How did you sleep? Well well.
All right. Tell me, are you good at DIY?
No, no, sir, I am a real mess.
In fact when I prick a wheel, my wife changes it.
Are you telling me you don't have a drill?
No. Think well what you say,
because I have a damn polygraph here.
Yes.
Second opportunity. Are you good at DIY?
I can defend myself. Take a step forward.
(Crying)
What is your name?
-Sonsoles. -Sonsoles, step forward.
Would you feel better if we bring you an anxiolytic?
-Yes please. -Very good very good.
Does anyone else need medication? -I. I am diabetic,
I would need insulin for this afternoon.
-Very good, come with Sonsoles, please, fast.
-And me.
I am taking sertraline.
-Someone else?
I.
I would like to order an abortion pill.
He said he doesn't know how many days we'll be here
and I would like to solve it as soon as possible.
(BERLIN) He will have it today. You come with me,
I will take them to Mr. Román's office, they will be calmer.
-Sorry, I also have a request.
(BERLIN) Yes?
-I would like to go online and delete a photo.
-I'm sorry, but that's not in my hand.
-It's that they cheated me, they took me to a bathroom
and they made me a nude photo.
And now my parents, my teachers, all the press are watching.
-You can record a message, a video, to calm down,
And we will send it.
All of you can record messages for your families.
Nairobi, joy.
-Come, macho, hands behind head
and to the left in Indian row, pulling chest
as if you were the selection. Come on, athlete.
Come on.
Do you see this dotted line?
What if you see it, balls?
You are going to break the concrete without leaving an inch of it,
as if it were a children's cutout.
There are 48 meters down until you reach the collector.
The shifts will be three hours. And when you finish your turn
and come back with the hostages, not a fucking word
of what we are doing down here.
Any questions? Do not.
That's fine, that's what I've explained.
Well, come to the pit. You put on the helmets
and pick up the hammer. I have never driven one of those.
(MOSCOW) There is always a first time.
And beware.
That you won't be the first to lose a foot with that.
Stop stop Stop.
Let's see, relax your knees, you're going to get rid of it.
And enjoy, pussy.
Dad, mom, I'm fine. (RIVER) In Spanish, please.
-Hello Dad. Hi Mom.
I think about you and Lis a lot.
I'm fine, they feed us and I've slept in a sack,
Like in a camp
Mom, this is not a horror, okay? There is no violence.
I imagine you'll be crying all day
thinking we should be in Belfast,
but you just have to think that I'm fine
That I will leave, that we will all leave.
Mom, mom
I imagine you have seen the photo that uploaded to the Internet.
I did not upload that photo nor it has to do with the kidnapping,
He was a partner who cheated on me and ...
I can not.
I don't know very well what your parents are saying
when you are in a kidnapping
And you show a tit on the Internet.
(RIVER) Well, you think the phone is not active.
So we can repeat the video as many times as you want
and then we send the one you like best.
(ALISON) Like in the fake shots of a movie?
-Yes.
Do not give so much importance to this photo,
It's like when you do topless on the beach, you know?
That nobody cares.
-I'm not one of those who do topless on the beach.
Not even those who roll up with boys in the bathrooms of a museum.
Having my arm in plaster has been the most exciting
What happened to me this year.
A kidnapping is more exciting.
Well, you think what you're going to say to your parents,
okay? And calm, I wait for you. Bring.
Are you serious, what's wrong with you? What the hell does he give you the most?
If I'm just a kid, the bedtime hobby
of these five months, right?
The fool of the plate.
I said you were a kid and I would never be with you
so they wouldn't put a bullet in your sternum,
because they put it in me brings me to the pairo.
(LAUGHTER) You don't believe that or you, you haven't done it for me.
What's wrong with you all, uncle? What since I entered
Do not stop riding chickens.
A phone has been turned on.
It's Alison Parker's.
- Hack it.
(RIVER) Do you know what happens? I'm sure you've waited
to leave Toledo to start
With all this fucking shit I'm a kid.
You are trying to enter your profile.
-Come on, come on, come on.
If it was your fucking gigolo, tell it to my face.
You were my fucking gigolo.
You were everything.
I'm in. - Record.
I don't want to continue with this conversation.
You have the holy balls to say you're mourning
for your boyfriend, right? You didn't seem very mourning
when you asked me to recess you against the wall,
I didn't see the rosary between your fingers.
As you talk to me like that again, I leave your face.
Go to "selfie" camera.
(LAUGHTER) Hey, uh, what the hell are you doing, what the hell are you doing?
-Nerd! - I shit on God, bring here!
-Just a moment!
It has disconnected.
-Rewind.
For the. Duplicate pixels
We have it.
You know my bubbles are magical, don't you?
(ALL) Yes!
-Because the wishes are fulfilled.
(Mobile)
Yes?
(MAN) "I have a gift for the girl, I'm at the door."
-You have a restraining order, get out of here.
- "I want to see my daughter on her birthday.
And you can trample me, but not her. "
-I am recording you.
Aitana
What have you got there?
What do you have in your hand, honey? -I have nothing.
-Show me.
Let's see, open your hand.
Open your hand. What is this, where did you get this?
-Where we paint the butterflies.
(Phone)
Yes.
- "You call me at six in the morning and leave me a confusing message
where you talk about straw inspector,
of gorillas and cacareos. What would you like to be elastic
and take off your panties. Anyway, nothing you will consider. "
You resign and leave a robbery with 67 hostages inside.
"So I call you simply
so that you tell me the fucking face that you are not going to occupy yourself. "
-Yes, I'm going to take care of it.
-Raquel, there are things that are above you.
National Security, Foreign, the CNI ...
But remember it well, you are the only person I know
"That can solve this without violence."
-Thanks, commissioner.
-And now go back to that tent and take over,
We have the face of a robber.
(NAIROBI) Let it not decay, come on, come on, come on!
I know they are tired, but there is one hour, one hour left!
One more hour, a million in an hour
and what about you, I swear on my mother!
Come on man!
To burst the machine, to put it to the top!
This has not been done by anyone!
They are going to kill us. But what are you saying?
They are going to kill us. (SISEA)
And then they will escape through the tunnel
that we are building They are going to make a marinade.
Shut up now, you don't know anything.
Think a little, huh? Do you think these people
It's so stupid to let us go
and that we go to the police station to recognize them? Think, pussy.
We are screwed. Twice, two, I've been told already
I'm a dead man
(Far blow)
Look to see what's under the canvas. Hey?
Look to see what's underneath. I will not stay here
waiting like a rabbit on my knees to be killed
without doing anything. Look under the canvases,
Look to see if there are weapons at least, it goes.
I cover you, come on. No, no.
Lay a couple of eggs. What's up, captain?
No, no. Weren't you the captain
of the rugby team? Of athletics.
Well run.
There are carafes.
(HUSMEA)
It is gasoline. Fuck
And ammo. The mother who bore me.
What is that?
Is this drug?
This is heroine. It's heroine, uncle.
Fuck, stop that, leave it right now, it's explosive plastic, pussy.
Leave it, come to dig, come to dig.
(TOSE)
Can you tell why it is not working
that machine? (ARTURO) We are on a break.
You will rest when I tell you. Or when I touch you.
Ok, ok, now we come back.
Inspector, please. (ALL TALK AT ONCE)
Is there a conflict between Intelligence and the Police?
- Is the abandonment of the negotiation due to your family situation
Following your complaint of abuse? -That?
-Alright, okay?
(RACHEL) How does carrion know that? -I do not know.
And back?
- Do you have a minute? -Sure.
-Colonel Prieto.
Look, I've been a little nervous these last hours,
but I would like to maintain a more fluid communication with you,
I think we both have a lot to contribute in this crisis.
-I appreciate your mea culpa. And here he has me,
at your entire disposal. But I want him to know,
before there is any misunderstanding,
I'm a married man
-Raquel, Rachel.
Male, no more than 25 years, we recorded with his mobile
from Alison Parker. -Identity?
-We are in it, facial recognition
They are looking at PERPOL.
-I want to see the full video. (ANGEL) Put the picture.
We could not record more than six seconds.
-Stop it there.
-It looks like a Makarov.
-No, it's a Strizh 9 mm, it's also Russian.
It is very rare to see them here.
-Talk with the judicial, to interrogate
to all the confidants of the East who control the black market.
What is that about the wall? (PRIETO) Phones.
-Put me the images of the rear camera.
What do you put on the labels? Expand
Hostage list?
They are their phones.
-The recognition can have the identity
In one hour, in two.
-No, we won't wait that long.
(Ringtone)
(Phone)
(Classical music)
Doesn't this special connection catch your attention?
I was going to call her right now, right now.
Well, considering that I am the negotiator
and you the robber ... But we shouldn't allow
That this crime interferes with our relationship.
I don't know about you, I see it as an opportunity.
"An opportunity for what?" To know each other.
"I assure you that if we had met
In a bar, I wouldn't have paid the slightest attention.
Tell me, inspector. "
Have you ever faked an orgasm?
Do not.
Please, inspector, I ask you not to lie to me.
Think about it for a moment, please.
Maybe yes, maybe I have.
Look, the man is programmed to ejaculate
in the shortest possible time; the woman, to last
The most time possible. And that little license
Nature's nature is sometimes settled with a fake orgasm.
That is nothing other than a small scam, a lie.
"Like last night's intervention, with three elite bodies.
Inspector, I ask you please don't lie to me,
will endanger innocent people. "
I will not do it. And now tell me, what did you want to call me for?
Look, we need food and a series of drugs:
insulin, sertraline, albuterol, an abortion pill
and anxiolytics. -An abortion pill?
They are hostage requests.
We all have personal problems, don't you think?
It will have your requests. All right.
It will be Civil Protection who makes the delivery,
with transparent bags to prevent concealment of weapons.
And now tell me, you called me to ...
To give up immediately.
I've got images from there,
"I have the identity of one of you.
And if I keep pulling the thread, I'll get the identity
from the rest of the band. "
Inspector, I think ... "I offer a deal with the prosecution."
I can lower their sentences from 16 to 8 years old,
that if they leave there now.
"There have been no deaths and that gives me some margin."
I don't think it's a fair deal, we lose out.
They have already lost. Look, in the unlikely case
that they get out of there, their faces will be on news,
Police stations and borders.
They have run out of plan B.
We will then activate the C plan. - You think I'm bluffing, right?
Frankly, yes.
To see that I do not lie I will give you a piece of information:
It has 67 mobile phones attached with Velcro on the wall.
I give it an hour to accept my proposal.
Listen to me, inspector ...
(RIVER) What if it doesn't work out?
-What will happen if it doesn't work out? (NAIROBI) Let's see, puppy,
the same as always: back to the teal,
to the cigarette in the yard, to the four prawns for Christmas,
Vis a vis, sometimes. -A luxury, come on.
The fucking thing is if it goes well. What the fuck are we going to do
with so much pasta?
(DENVER) I'm going to catch a Maserati,
blue sky clear, huh?
-Say yes. -And a martial arts gym.
(NAIROBI) I see it.
(DENVER) And a three-story whistle, huh?
With speakers that bleed your ears.
Pum, pum, pam, what pim pam pum. -Say yes.
-This with three million left over. -And for you some lungs,
that you have made them crap from the mine.
- In that you are going to spend it, in some lungs?
Come on, you're worth it.
And you can know where the hell are you going to get some lungs from?
Are there no people who sell kidneys? There will be people who sell lungs,
I say. (LAUGH)
-Well, I am in a cellar in Provence.
In hectares of vineyards to grow my own wine,
Oak barrels...
-But you can go to the supermarket you want
and buy the bottle that comes out of the eggs,
Why are you going to set up a warehouse?
-For art.
(LAUGH)
Well, I want an island.
-And me another. -Well, put on three.
Three are a crowd now. (NAIROBI) An archipelago.
(RIVER) No, well, I want an island that has a huge house,
with a balcony that is attached to the sea.
I get out of bed and head to the water.
-Well, finally someone smart.
-It's that I think some of us have to fix first
some matter than another, right? Come on, at least I do.
And look, then with what about me then for a plane.
To drive it. Being able to have a good pilot.
No, you don't get it, it's cool to hesitate
to the control tower and say, "Look, give me hint
for the most artist. "
(LAUGH)
If we buy all those things, let's say for a price ...
I don't know, an expensive price, a very expensive price.
Even so we would still have a lot of money left over.
If we are going to steal big,
dream big.
-Well, I would record a record of corridos.
So, and on the cover all my mask.
(LAUGH)
-You're going to be like Bertín Osborne, but with 30 kilos more.
-Oh, oops. -What are you talking?
Bertin sings rancheras, I've told you corridos,
That is something very different.
- Show him what a bullfight is, dad.
-What not, man ... -Come on.
-Come on come on. Come go.
-But if you love it. -How am I going to sing?
(ALL) Sing, sing.
He has risen and everything.
# For the lack of your lips I cried for the first time
# and I cursed knowing you for not stop loving you.
# I my wife wanted to make you,
# without love I looked for luck,
# I was pulling a gun
# and fate brought death.
# Mary, my life, my love.
# I won't stop loving you,
# with bullets I lost you
# You won't see me again. #
(LAUGH)
(Ringtone)
Yes, teacher?
It has a picture of all the phones on the wall.
There is no security camera inside, right?
(BERLIN) No, of course not, only the one we put.
Then he has been one of the hostages.
You missed a phone, so find it
Or we are well screwed. Give me the green light to punish him.
Either we block them in panic or they will continue to be heroes.
What punishment? An exemplary punishment.
His execution, for example? Do not.
You find that phone.
We must notify the police and we must guide them in the assault.
There is a phone in my office, in a coat that is hung
in a coat rack. Not.
Listen to me, you've had 40 seconds ... Go.
I can not, I can not.
Do you know what would happen if someone is there?
They shoot me. The same as...
(MOSCOW) I want to hear that machine running, pussy!
And I don't want to repeat it again! -Sorry, excuse me, excuse me.
He's very tired. Sorry. (ARTURO) I can't anymore.
I'm going to die, I can't anymore. -Come on, get out of there.
Get out of there and rest.
"That phone that seemed like salvation to Arturo
It was actually stained with death.
And what they didn't do for cowardice
the most innocent would do it with that fatality that love gives,
sealing his destiny for the rest of his days. "
Are you really going to abort?
Sorry for what I told you yesterday, Monica.
It was out of place, I was an asshole.
I've never been a very brave guy, you know?
I've spent all my fucking life doing what others
They wanted from me, never what I wanted to do.
And a situation like this has had to come, fuck,
with guns and with bullets, to realize
Of what I really want.
And I will think about me.
In me and in you.
And in that child you have inside.
I love you, Monica.
I love you so much, I know that.
You are the best thing that ever happened to me.
I want you to continue with your pregnancy
and I want you to let me be the father.
We are going to have a child.
And I want us to start a family if we leave here.
How do we get out of here?
They are digging a tunnel. That?
Yes, they have a lot of plastic explosive
and gas bottles.
(BERLIN) Standing! They are going to make a marinade.
There is a way, contact the police
and guide them in the assault. I have a cell phone in my office,
in the coat
I don't know how to get there.
I'm going No no no.
(BERLIN) There is always a hero ...
Who thinks he can save others.
What do you think...
that nobody is going to realize that he is plotting
A strategy to contact the police.
Bravo.
Congratulations, because one of you has succeeded,
has recorded an image from here
and sent it to the police.
(ANGEL) Aníbal Cortés, a native of Getafe.
Alarm expert, worked for two years
in security companies, you are related to theft
of a mansion in Geneva, has an order
dictated by Interpol.
So I would like to give it a chance
to take a step to the center
so that all of you can thank him.
And by the way give me the phone.
He had to visit the Mint
to study alarm systems.
Search the hard drives of the security company.
With a little luck, maybe he accompanied him
Some other band member.
Helsinki
Undress it.
-Come on.
Are you sick or what's wrong with you?
-Attend.
-Come on, take off your shirt.
Come on. -He has been one of you.
I do not know who have been.
Denver, undress him.
You have recorded a video
in the phone room, right?
-What happens? I can't breathe
Talk to the girls. Talk to the girls!
Berlin, I take it.
-Berlin, Berlin. -What happens now?
-I know what happened.
An assault on the epicenter of money, the most unique theft in history.
Rocambolesco robo demands international attention.
How about? Want a coffee?
-Fuck, we have a policeman in the ICU,
from armed types to the teeth
and for the board members this is something picturesque.
-The headlines don't matter to me, which worries me
is that they have too much information and that does not help us.
-Listens. -Wait.
Listen to me all well.
Some of you are talking more with your brother-in-law,
with a neighbor or a journalist without knowing it.
Whoever leaves the tongue even if only to give
The damn hour will be suspended from employment and salary.
-You're good?
-I'm going out for a moment to eat and I'll be back in 15 minutes.
-Agree.
(PRIETO) I accompany her?
-Better not.
It is not going to be that his wife sees us and becomes jealous.
(ANGEL) "The inspector comes out. Withdraw the paparazzi."
(RIVER) I took a moment and saw that Alison was trying
delete the fucking photo, that's it. A mistake, nothing more.
-What happens, do you have attention deficit?
Because if you are one of those children with problems,
I should be the first to know.
-I have no problem.
- Tokyo entered, okay? And we had a few words, that's it.
It will not happen again. -Now I understand.
It all comes down once more to a sentimental issue.
You can't get an idea of ​​what you remind me of.
I was 18 and she 44, was my French teacher
and I just got an advantage. -I don't know what this is about,
Tokyo is not 44 years old. -He is 15 years older than you.
And when you're young and you're with a woman
that is coming to the equator, everything is sublimated.
They have the experience that teenagers lack
and they are even more grateful than the ugly ones.
My teacher handed me her mature meats every time
As if it were my damn birthday. You know why?
Because with you they taste the lost youth,
before waking up definitely
for the slope of the years.
Of course...
Of course there is a small difference between your love story and mine.
In my case I was not in a robbery with hostages,
endangering the lives of my colleagues.
(SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN)
(Phone)
Does it still hurt from yesterday or what? A bit.
Hey, what I told you about the rosary
It was not good, I was an asshole.
I'm sorry.
Yes, but I like you like that.
If I am subnormal.
I get into a robbery with 70 hostages and I there,
with the order plate. You are original
I don't think many aunts can boast something like that.
I was in awe. And when it’s encrusted,
You don't think well.
Besides, you said it yourself and you're right,
Love is not the same as a couple of jumps.
Are you trying to leave me
There is nothing to leave.
I just comment on the situation.
And what has changed from yesterday to today?
Well, what you said about age and that I don't see you spliced
With ours.
And I've been talking to the girl for five minutes ...
With Alison. Y...
And I've realized you're right
I have to look for a young girl, like her.
Fuck, what a host you have.
Will you give me back the plate?
Your insert.
Look who's coming.
So is it clear what you have to say?
-Yes sir. -Wonderful,
catching the lesson on the fly.
Ready?
(WOMAN) Leave the packages on the floor and back up very slowly.
"I have a cell phone in my office in my coat."
How hot here.
I will...
Hey.
May l?
Sit down.
Sit down!
-The medicines have arrived.
Share them.
I am going to sit down. Wait.
Come out.
Come out.
It will seem like a fucking shit what I'm going to tell you.
It doesn't make much sense to tell you this.
an uncle with a gun, right?
To me that abortions do not seem very good idea.
(RACHEL) Thank you.
(TELEVISION) "The kidnappers are locked up
at the National Currency Factory .. ".
They don't move from there, huh?
Those people say. I imagine they will be gaining time
to establish some kind of strategy or ...
You have to be desperate to do something like that, right?
That is what makes them so dangerous.
But they don't want to hurt anyone.
Well, that's what they said.
Then they wouldn't go armed, don't you think?
Sure, I guess he's right.
Although no one enters there to steal
with a slingshot, right?
The check, please.
And do you know how many they are?
Because in some places they say there are seven.
(Mobile)
Sorry.
Yes.
(ANGEL) - "The boy went to the museum". -How long?
- "Three months ago, the cameras captured him
being part of a guided tour. "
- Was he alone?
-No, you were right, I was accompanied. Listen, we have the identity
from another of the assailants, they sent you their picture
from Judicial, you have to be receiving it
right now.
Ah!
-Where do you have it? What are you talking about?
Where do you have the recorder? But what...?
What a coincidence that you are here every day
asking me questions. I do not know what...
What medium are you from? How?
What are you fucking mean? I am not a journalist,
My name is Salvador Martí, look at my wallet.
Antonio, please. - What's up, Salva?
I know him, he comes every day.
You need pasta for the kid, right?
Yes No No...
Yes. Listen to me, we are in a robbery, you can take something the same.
No the truth.
Hide this in your underwear now.
diapers to the kid
Until the end of the race. Is not that.
It really isn't that. I appreciate it, but ...
Give me the pill and I'll turn inside.
Okay.
So what's up?
That is going to fuck your life. That?
Your son. Better fuck your son's life
that not any of these son of a bitch or me.
Are you going to fuck my life? Life gets screwed by looking at her,
one day you are in your work quietly,
you get four hanged with Dalí masks,
one gets his head, he misses a shot
and to take for ass.
This screwes your life.
A boy no
A baby does not fuck your life. What do you know what screwes me?
What do you know?
My mother went to abort.
Of course, before he became a Chinese with the horse he had to sell
To pay for the abortion.
And in a shitty porch he caught his munipa.
Between the jail, the drug and the police I was born.
So, what do you know?
Because it seems that you have a job that is not one adventure after another,
that when you leave here it is not a party either.
Or are you going to "carats"? Pilates ...
More in my favor. And drinks on Fridays.
What a bitch, aunt, another plan that gets screwed by the kid.
And with whom do you go out for drinks, where are your friends?
I tell you, at home, with the kids.
Do you see them fucked? No, right?
What do you do that is so crazy that you can not do with a child?
Do you go to India in summer to spend 15 days with a bagpipe?
Because for that you go to Gandía, that you can drink from the tap
and eat "piza".
If the father is such an asshole to miss it, better,
All the love to you. Do you know everything you may want?
(BERLIN) What are you doing, Denver?
-I'm giving him the pill to abort.
-What happens, you need to put it in your mouth
with a little water?
-Abortion is a private thing, isn't it?
Women decide, but not in front of everyone.
Anyway I ...
I'm going to think about it until we get out of here.
-Fantastic.
I'm glad you want to move on with pregnancy,
really.
Now go back to the office with the others.
(Message)
(CRY)
Are you coming from a bachelorette party?
Or were you going?
"That was not the first time Berlin reached out
in the panties of an honest woman,
but it was going to be the first time I took it out so soon.
Maybe Monica would have preferred to be carried away
by your instinct and you will forget the phone
that had sounded between his legs, but it wasn't like that. "
Denver
What will happen to our authority
When I tell others?
"Even Berlin knew how to differentiate pleasure from duty."
Kill her.
You have already heard me.
(NAIROBI) Let's see.
"You can intuit it, but in a fraction of a second
you suddenly realize that things don't add up
and that Rio still loved me and hadn't left me because.
I felt it so hard that it crossed the walls,
as strong as the love that I always end up feeling
For all the men who take care of me
whether they are drug dealers, morons, children.
And it felt the same as the first day I held him in my arms,
the two lying between the stones of a Toledo field. "
We return in 30 minutes.
Excuse me.
Well, I'm going to run a little, to stretch my legs a little.
- Throw it, will it be by field?
Learning a language is much easier than it seems,
but you have to leave the semantics aside.
"For the first time I realized that I had always failed
One thing in all my love stories
They had always taken care of me.
But this time it was going to be different. "
(SCREAM)
(NAIROBI) What's up? Fuck, Tokyo, Tokyo. Tokyo!
Fuck, go for Berlin.
(Phone)
(Phone)
Listen to me. If someone puts a hand on it again,
I swear to God, the next shot
It will go against Helsinki, against Berlin or against you.
You are out there, in freedom, we are playing
The fucking life in this mousetrap.
(SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN)
Helsinki, put the gun down.
(BERLIN) What are you supposed to be doing?
Helsinki
Helsinki
Lower the weapon.
(CRIES) No, please.
(DENVER) Why did you have to take that fucking mobile?
What the fuck did you have to fool me for?
Rio, no!
(BERLIN) Where do you think you are going? You have done enough for today.
Helsinki
(SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN)
Do you know what will happen if I don't kill you?
Well, they are going to kill me.
And then they will kill you.
And now that?
"I didn't even hear what I was shouting, I just wanted to write
A damn love letter. While the rifles and looks
they pointed at me, reality fell like a block of cement
and I knew that the five months in which I had believed in something
They were done. "
Your love story has shit
Your escape plan, they have you.
And to Rio too, the police know who you are.
You are in all the news.
I fall for the whore.
Go, uncle, go.
Get on your knees.
Do not.
(DENVER) Don't look at me.
Do not look at me.
Please. Don't look at my fucking face
Don't look at my fucking face
Everybody at the floor!
(HELSINKI) Quiet!
(BERLIN) For the last time, return to your position.
